Here is the prompt;
make your own (private) repository in terminal
add components like README.md and .gitignore
make a file and stage it
commit this file in the terminal
make some changes locally to this file, and then commit the changes
commit another file, and then remove it locally.
what do you do if you want to ‘recover’ this file locally based on the online repository?
remove this file locally again, and commit the removal.
bonus points if you could:
make a branch in your repo
understand e.g. issues, pull requests, and work with others (since the repo is private, I think you need to give access to people as collaborators) using these.
And here are some resources which will help you with it.
