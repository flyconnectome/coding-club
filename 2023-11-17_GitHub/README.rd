This session is focused on getting started in Git and GitHub. You can find resources to help you with this task in the how_to repository. Here is the prompt;
- download and install Git
- make your own repository in terminal
- add components like README.md and .gitignore
- make a file and stage it
- commit this file in the terminal
- make some changes to this file, and then commit the changes
- commit another file, and then remove it.
- what do you do if you want to ‘recover’ this file? (git reset/revert)
- remove this file again, and commit the removal.
- make a repository that is linked to GitHub, either by making one on there and cloning it to your computer, or linking up your pre-existing repo.
- make a change, commit it, and push to the remote repo
- visit GitHub in your browser and change a file using the user interface
- git pull the change to your local computer.

bonus points if you could:
- make a branch in your repo
- understand e.g. issues, pull requests, and work with others (since the repo is private, I think you need to give access to people as collaborators) using these.
