Exercise: AL Connectivity stereotypy

a. Read AL_library/AL_bodies seatable and extract all ALLNs (cell_class).

b. Find downstream partners of ALLNs.

c. Group ALLNs morphologically.

d. Assess connectivity stereotypy from ALLNs to downstream partners - Plot normalised synapse count to downstream partners per ALLN morphological group.

e. Plot morphological groups in different colours in a flywire scene.

f. Plot locations of synapse clouds per morphological groups of ALLNs, divided by dendritic and axonal arbors. Do specific morphological groups innervate specific areas of the AL?
