Connecivity exercise with Flywire neurons:
1. Find downstream partners of 720575940603560294 (LHa1 hemilineage)
2. Get the neuronâ€™s top five partners based on the number of synapses
3. Plot the neuron and each partner (include the synapses in the plot) for all five neurons, and have the synapses colour coded by partner

Advanced task
1. Construct a neuroglancer scene with the neuron of interest and its top five partners (note: the top five partners should be the same color as it's relevant synapse colour assigned in point 3)
2. NBLAST connectivity matrix of the LHa1 hemilineage [thresholds 1. include adequate/complete neurons 2. include connections with more than 5 synapses per neuron]
