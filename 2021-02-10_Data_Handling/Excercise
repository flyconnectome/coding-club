Exercise
1 Get all the upstream neurons for Flywalkies
2 Subset a data frame of the upstream neurons into these four categories [uPN, mPN, MBON and Other] 
3 Create a data frame of the percentage of upstream neurons in the categories

Bonus: Present the results in a graph :chart_with_upwards_trend:
